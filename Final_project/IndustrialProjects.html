<p> This project focuses on programming a machine to be able to detect small particles (foreign objects) inside of bottles of liquid. The driving need for this kind of engineering comes from our ever-changing world of food and drink administration, as well as the potential for new contaminants to arise in our water, juice, alcohol, or any number of bottled drinks. This technology is used in many food and drink distributors and utlizes strong cameras and expert coding to achieve maximum results of efficiency to give the commonwealth some peace of mind. </p>

<p> Virtual and augmented reality provides great potentials for various applications, such as gaming [10], education [23], medical training [14] and so on. In VR/AR, people directly acquire and manipulate virtual objects as if in the real world. Therefore, in VR/AR applications, object acquisition should be the fundamental operation. It would be of great significance to improve such a basic operation.</p>
<p></p>
<p> Currently, acquiring an object in VR/AR is eyes-engaged: A user has to move or rotate his/her head to visually locate an object before acquiring it [21]. In physical world, however, acquisition of an object does not necessarily require eye’s articipation [12]. In many cases, by leveraging the spatial memory and proprioception, people can reach for an object in an eyes-free manner (e.g. a driver reaches gear stick while driving). In this research, we want to take advantage of users’ eyes-free input ability to improve interaction in VR/AR, by allowing users to acquire an object without looking at it. </p>

<h1> Reducing Arm Fatigue in VR with 3D-Spatial Offset: </h1>

<p>Virtual Reality Head Mounted Displays (HMD) are gaining popularity with the development of head-mounted displays. In future, we can envision people using this platform as part of their daily routine, just like desktop computers.</p>
<p></p>
<p> Even though interaction inside virtual reality is a huge boost for the progress of revolutionizing virtual reality, this interaction gives birth to the arm-fatigue problem also known as ‘‘Gorilla arm’’. This problem is known to harm users as using hand gestures in mid-air for longer periods of time can cause pain and strain in arms, which makes the experience of virtual reality less delightful.</p>
<p></p>
<p> This work attempts to address this fatigue problem by using a combination of feasible techniques, we call ‘‘ProxyHand’’ and ‘‘StickHand’’. These techniques have shown to significantly reduce strain and fatigue in the arms of the VR users. ProxyHand and StickHand enable users to flexibly adjust the 3D spatial offset between the physical hand and its virtual representation in VR. This technique will allow users to keep their arms in a comfortable position even when they have to manipulate objects in locations that requires lifting of arms using the default interaction method. Users can also reset this offset whenever they want by using our technique.</p>
